This is a living list of all of the optimization tasks/improvements that should be completed when possible.

X   Consolidate as much of the repeated CSS as possible. 
    There are many elements that have repeated styling, 
    but can just share the same styling.

*   Ensure that the site is actually responsive (test on different devices);
    Consider porting site to REACT framework

*   Modularize the Learn page to separate each course out 
    into their own HTML file that is served using includes.js
    -   Consider using JSON

*   Ensure that all code is formatted consistently (ordering 
    of attributes in CSS, indentation, etc.)

X   Improve site architecture / organize files so they aren't 
    all in the same subdirectory

*   Add comments to aid in documentation

*   Integrate HubSpot CMS
